### What I learned

This project was a great learning experience that challenged me in several ways. Building a multi-step form allowed me to work with Reactâ€™s useReducer hook, which proved to be an efficient tool for managing complex state logic. I also leveraged the Context API to pass data through deeply nested components, effectively avoiding prop drilling. Ensuring accessibility presented a technical challenge, but it helped me write cleaner, more inclusive code and strengthened my understanding of accessibility guidlines and best practises. Additionally, I learned to use Framer Motion to implement smooth, visually appealing animations throughout the form.
